### Floor 0 - Fiber Cables

* For the connection of Intermediate Cross-Connect(IC) to Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) we choose Monomode optical fibre
  because itÂ´s immune/less susceptible to dispersion and thus allows higher data rates. <br><br>

### Floor 0 - Cooper Cables

* To connect the Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) to all Outlets we use Copper Cables CAT7.  <br><br>
* We chose this cable type they can support faster data transfer rates (10 Gbps) and more simultaneous connections, which
  is important for modern applications. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are generally more cost-effective than fiber optic cables. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are compatible with a wide range of network devices.(end-user equipment is not usually prepared for fiber optic cables) <br><br>


### Floor 0 - Outlet

* The number of outlets we can place in a room was calculated using the areas previously mentioned.<br> <br>
* The structured cabling standards say that for each 10m<sup>2</sup>, we should have at least 2 outlets.<br><br>
* There was some care to avoid placing equipment too close to doors to avoid damage.<br><br>
* Some areas have more than 2 outlets per 10m<sup>2</sup> to provide flexibility for user, for this to happen we make sure that outlets always be
  less than 3m away from others outlets.<br>

### Floor 0 - Consolidation Point

* For this floor there will be 4 Consolidation Point.<br><br>
* 1st on Room D.0.11 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.0.10 to D.0.14
* 2nd on Room D.0.6 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.0.5 to D.0.9
* 3rd on Room D.0.3 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.0.3 and D.0.4
* 4th on Room D.0.2 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.0.1 to D.0.2
* This Consolidation are placed in this local's because this floor will have 69 Outlets, so using this Consolidation Points
  we can avoid to use a Patch Panel of 48 female connectors and can have a better organization on our structured cabling.


### Floor 0 - Access Point

* We choose to place 4 Access Point to this at the top of the main corridor at four different locations<br><br>
* Usually an Access Point will grant approximate a 50 meters diameter circle of coverage, but this is relative to an empty area.
  But in a Building like our we have walls that will interfere. So we only are considering a coverage of 30 meters.<br><br>
* We choose to place this Access Point on this local because it's near of all rooms.<br><br>


### Floor 0 - Horizontal Cross Connect

* The Horizontal cross-connect (HC) was placed in the room D.0.15 because this room it's a storage room and also contains the passageway to the floor above
  and provides easy access to the other rooms on that floor. <br>

### Floor 0 - Intermediate Cross Connect

* The Intermediate cross-connect (IC) was placed in the room D.0.15 because this room it's a storage room and also contains the passageway to the floor above
  and being the most efficient way regarding the cabling. <br>

### Floor 1 - Fiber Cables

* For the connection of Intermediate Cross-Connect(IC) to Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) we choose Monomode optical fibre
  because itÂ´s immune/less susceptible to dispersion and thus allows higher data rates. <br><br>

### Floor 1 - Cooper Cables

* To connect the Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) to all Outlets we use Copper Cables CAT7.  <br><br>
* We chose this cable type they can support faster data transfer rates (10 Gbps) and more simultaneous connections, which
  is important for modern applications. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are generally more cost-effective than fiber optic cables. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are compatible with a wide range of network devices.(end-user equipment is not usually prepared for fiber optic cables) <br><br>


### Floor 1 - Outlet

* The number of outlets we can place in a room was calculated using the areas previously mentioned.<br> <br>
* The structured cabling standards say that for each 10m<sup>2</sup>, we should have at least 2 outlets.<br><br>
* There was some care to avoid placing equipment too close to doors to avoid damage.<br><br>
* Some areas have more than 2 outlets per 10m<sup>2</sup> to provide flexibility for user, for this to happen we make sure that outlets always be
  less than 3m away from others outlets.<br>

### Floor 1 - Consolidation Point

* For this floor there will be 4 Consolidation Point.<br><br>
* 1st on Room D.1.9 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.1.2, D.1.4, D.1.6, D.1.9 and D.1.11
* 2nd on Room D.1.14 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.1.13 to D.1.17
* 3rd on Room D.1.7 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.1.7, D.1.10 and D.1.12
* 4th on Room D.1.5 that will host outlets of rooms -> D.1.1, D.1.3 and D.1.5
* This Consolidation are placed in this local's because this floor will have 69 Outlets, so using this Consolidation Points
  we can avoid to use a Patch Panel of 48 female connectors and can have a better organization on our structured cabling.


### Floor 1 - Access Point

* We choose to place 4 Access Point to this at the top of the main corridor at four different locations<br><br>
* Usually an Access Point will grant approximate a 50 meters diameter circle of coverage, but this is relative to an empty area.
  But in a Building like our we have walls that will interfere. So we only are considering a coverage of 30 meters.<br><br>
* We choose to place this Access Point on this local because it's near of all rooms.<br><br>


### Floor 1 - Horizontal Cross Connect

* The Horizontal cross-connect (HC) was placed in the room D.1.8 because this room it's a storage room and also contains the passageway to the floor above
  and provides easy access to the other rooms on that floor. <br>
