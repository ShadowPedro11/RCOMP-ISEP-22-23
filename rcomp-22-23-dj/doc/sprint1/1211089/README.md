### Floor 0 - Fiber Cables

* For the connection of Intermediate Cross-Connect(IC) to Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) we choose Monomode optical fibre
  because itÂ´s immune/less susceptible to dispersion and thus allows higher data rates. <br><br>

### Floor 0 - Cooper Cables

* To connect the Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) to all Outlets we use Copper Cables CAT7.  <br><br>
* We chose this cable type they can support faster data transfer rates (10 Gbps) and more simultaneous connections, which
  is important for modern applications. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are generally more cost-effective than fiber optic cables. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are compatible with a wide range of network devices.(end-user equipment is not usually prepared for fiber optic cables) <br><br>


### Floor 0 - Outlet

* The number of outlets we can place in a room was calculated using the areas previously mentioned.<br> <br>
* The structured cabling standards say that for each 10m<sup>2</sup>, we should have at least 2 outlets.<br><br>
* There was some care to avoid placing equipment too close to doors to avoid damage.<br><br>
* Some areas have more than 2 outlets per 10m<sup>2</sup> to provide flexibility for user, for this to happen we make sure that outlets always be
  less than 3m away from others outlets.<br>

### Floor 0 - Consolidation Point

* For this floor there will be 4 Consolidation Point.<br><br>
* 1st on Room C.0.11 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.0.9 to C.0.13
* 2nd on Room C.0.7 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.0.5 to C.0.8
* 3rd on Room C.0.2 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.0.1 to C.0.2
* 4th on Room C.0.4 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.0.3 to C.0.4
* This Consolidation are placed in this local's because this floor will have 73 Outlets, so using this Consolidation Points
  we can avoid to use a Patch Panel of 48 female connectors and can have a better organization on our structured cabling.


### Floor 0 - Access Point

* We choose to place 4 Access Point to this at the top of the main corridor at four different locations<br><br>
* Usually an Access Point will grant approximate a 50 meters diameter circle of coverage, but this is relative to an empty area.
  But in a Building like our we have walls that will interfere. So we only are considering a coverage of 30 meters.<br><br>
* We choose to place this Access Point on this local because it's near of all rooms and have less interference from walls
  than if it was placed inside a room.<br><br>


### Floor 0 - Horizontal Cross Connect

* The Horizontal cross-connect (HC) was placed in the room C.0.14 because this room it's a storage room and also contains the passageway to the floor above
  and provides easy access to the other rooms on that floor. <br>

### Floor 1 - Cooper Cables

* To connect the Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) to all Outlets we use Copper Cables CAT7.  <br><br>
* We chose this cable type they can support faster data transfer rates (10 Gbps) and more simultaneous connections, which
  is important for modern applications. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are generally more cost-effective than fiber optic cables. <br><br>
* Copper Cables CAT7 are compatible with a wide range of network devices.(end-user equipment is not usually prepared for fiber optic cables) <br><br>


### Floor 1 - Outlet

* The number of outlets we can place in a room was calculated using the areas previously mentioned.<br> <br>
* The structured cabling standards say that for each 10m<sup>2</sup>, we should have at least 2 outlets.<br><br>
* There was some care to avoid placing equipment too close to doors to avoid damage.<br><br>
* Some areas have more than 2 outlets per 10m<sup>2</sup> to provide flexibility for user, for this to happen we make sure that outlets always be
  less than 3m away from others outlets.<br>

### Floor 1 - Consolidation Point

* For this floor there will be 4 Consolidation Point.<br><br>
* 1st on Room C.1.13 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.1.9 to C.1.13
* 2nd on Room C.1.17 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.1.14 to C.1.18
* 3rd on Room C.1.19 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.1.19 to C.1.20 and C.1.5 to C.1.7
* 4th on Room C.1.4 that will host outlets of rooms -> C.1.1 to C.1.4
* This Consolidation are placed in this local's because this floor will have 80 Outlets, so using this Consolidation Points
  we can avoid to use a Patch Panel of 48 female connectors and can have a better organization on our structured cabling.


### Floor 1 - Access Point

* We choose to place 2 Access Point, one inside the room C.1.16 and another one in the room C.1.4<br><br>
* Usually an Access Point will grant approximate a 50 meters diameter circle of coverage, but this is relative to an empty area.
  But in a Building like our we have walls that will interfere. So we only are considering a coverage of 30 meters.<br><br>
* We choose to place this Access Point on this local because it's near of all rooms and have less interference from walls
  than if it was placed inside a room.<br><br>


### Floor 1 - Horizontal Cross Connect

* The Horizontal cross-connect (HC) was placed in the room C.1.8 because this room it's a storage room and also contains the passageway to the floor below
