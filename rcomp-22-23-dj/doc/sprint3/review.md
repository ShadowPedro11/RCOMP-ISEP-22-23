RCOMP 2022-2023 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================


### Sprint master: 1211128 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
# 1. Sprint's backlog #
In this sprint, each team member will keep working on the same network simulation from the previous
sprint (concerning the same building). From the already established layer three configurations, now,
OSPF based dynamic routing will be used to replace the previously used static routing.
